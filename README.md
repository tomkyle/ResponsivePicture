- [Picturefill on Github](https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill)




##Getting started

    <?php
    use \tomkyle\ResponsivePicture\MinWidthSource;
    use \tomkyle\ResponsivePicture\ResponsivePicture;
    use \tomkyle\ResponsivePicture\ResponsivePictureView;

    $pic = new ResponsivePicture( '//placehold.it/300x300', "Sample image");
    
    $pic->add( new MinWidthSource(1200, '//placehold.it/1200x1200, //placehold.it/2400x2400 2x'));
    $pic->add( new MinWidthSource(800,  '//placehold.it/800x800,   //placehold.it/1600x1600 2x'));
    $pic->add( new MinWidthSource(480,  '//placehold.it/480x480,   //placehold.it/960x960   2x'));

	$pic_view = new ResponsivePictureView( $pic );
	echo $pic_view;
	?>
	
###Re-using the `ResponsivePictureView` 

Just invoke the `ResponsivePictureView` instance from above with another `ResponsivePicture` instance:

	<?php
    $pic2 = new ResponsivePicture( '//placehold.it/300x300', "Another image");
    $pic2->add( new MinWidthSource(1200, '//placehold.it/1200x600, //placehold.it/2400x1200 2x'));

    echo $pic_view( $pic2 );
    ?>
